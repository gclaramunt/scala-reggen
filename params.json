C to cat. D is a pair of functions one maps objects of C to D and the other maps arrows of C to D\r\nfunctor F:C→D, A ∈C⇒FA∈D, f ∈C⇒Ff∈D\r\n\r\nA functor must satisfy the following laws:\r\nFf:FA→FB\r\nF(f∘g)=Ff∘Fg\r\nFidA=idFA\r\n\r\n(TO BE DONE:)\r\n\r\n### Initial Algebras\r\n(how types and functions are a category)\r\n(how type constructors )\r\n(how types can be described as an algebra of functors)\r\n\r\n### Folds\r\n\r\n(define fold)\r\n  (laws)\r\n\r\n(how fold is the unversal operation)\r\n","google":"UA-1731182-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
